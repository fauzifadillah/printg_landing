      <h2>Our History</h2>
      <div className="CardGroupHistory">
      <p id="hist_step1" data-aos="fade-left">PrintG was established for the need of multi - disciplinary approachs in Nano Technology Development. Nanotechnology Research Group (NTRG) was initially established in year 2005 in the Department of Physics merely focusing on the synthesis of nanomaterials for luminescence applications, financial support such as from Directorate of Higher Education, Ministry of Research and Technology and Indonesia Toray Science Foundation, Loreal Science Foundation were acquired. Many equipments supporting the synthesis and dispersion of nanomaterials were developed and received financial support for research under PUNAS Scheme (National Research Excellent Scheme) from Ministry of Research, Technology and Higher Education.  </p>
      <p id="hist_step2" data-aos="fade-right">Since 2013, NTRG was a authorized research laboratory with the name 'Laboratory of Instrumentation System and Functional Material Processing' (well-known as eSPe Lab) in the Department of Physics.  Many collaborations were established with Industries, laboratories/Faculties within the University and other local University and Abroad Institutions/Industries. Within the University, we established research collaborations with Petrography Lab., Faculty of Dentistry, Faculty of Husbandry, Faculty of Agriculture, and Faculty of Pharmacy. From other Universities, we established collaborations with Corrosion Laboratory Institute Technology of Sepuluh Nopember (ITS), Thermal Fluid Engineering and Material Processing Hiroshima University, Chemical Engineering Tokyo Univ. of Agriculture Technology and Dept. of Resources and Environmental Engineering, Waseda University. Actively collaborates with Industries such as PT. Grafindo Nusantara, PT. Trans Sulawesi Tenggara, PT. Trans Sulawesi Sejahtera, PT. Trans Jawa Sulawesi, PT. Ultimate Carbometal Nusantara Dua,   PT. Carbonindo Nusantara Jaya, PT. Gunung Sabak, PT. Wali Mining, PT. Latambaga Raya, PT. Lasolo Karya Sejahtera PT. Eagle Rich Nusantara  and PT. Mekongga Sejahtera.</p>
      <p id="hist_step3" data-aos="fade-left">In order to enhance the spectrum of multi disciplinary approaches with broad applications, likewise National and International Collaborations, the development of Institution for Nanotechnology was proposed at the University level. Thus, in year of 2014 the Institutional Research Centre of Nanotechnology and Graphene was finally established (SK Rektor No. 3761/UN6.RKT/Kep/HK/2015).</p>
